#### My first hackathon yay! :)

I participated in a 48 hour hackathon held at the Google Campus in London, in the first week of march 2016.

The competition was to prototype/ develop an application that would help foreign migrants access health services within the UK.

The people, atmosphere and code and designs being banged out on laptops were all beautiful.
The event was a blast and I knew it would not be my last!

More event details to follow, meanwhile you can check the official photos on [flickr](https://www.flickr.com/photos/danielbayley80/albums/72157663156249483 "Official Photos").
