#### Techcrunch Hackathon #hackdisrupt


I participated in a 48 hour hackathon held at the Queen Elizabeth Olympic Park in London, in December 2016.

The vibe was awesome, it was great to see so many talented and competitive coders in one place!

The event was well catered for, free food, drink and whilst the coffee wasnt barista standards, it was on tap!

Although my team did not take any trophies that weekend, just being in that environment was a prize. Well, we got to keep our ~~weird~~ unique onsie/robe-y thing, so there's that xD

This post will be updated with more details soon.
