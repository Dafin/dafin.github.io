#### Thanks for popping by :)
Hi! I'm Dafin :) This website is an attempt making and updating a phlog*.
I anticipate posts will be about code, community, life and random thoughts.


*This Phlog is just an image centric blog, not to be confused with [rlogs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phlog "rlogs AKA plogs") - although like rlogs, these posts are just text files ([mark down](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Markdown "usually with a .md file extension")) and will probably be similarly rarely updated.

Enjoy the randomness x)
